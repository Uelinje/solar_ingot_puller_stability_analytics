# Solar Ingot Puller – Process Stability & Risk Analytics

## Executive Overview

This project demonstrates a structured analytics framework for quantifying
process instability and operational risk in solar ingot puller operations.

Using engineered control deviation (SP–PV gaps), rolling variability metrics,
and drift features derived from equipment telemetry, the pipeline identifies
high-risk operating regimes and isolates interpretable instability drivers.

The repository uses fully synthetic data for demonstration purposes. The
analytics methodology mirrors real-world industrial implementation while
preserving data confidentiality.
